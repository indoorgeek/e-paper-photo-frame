# E-Paper Photo Frame
Someone has rightly said that "Memories are special moments that tell our story!". I wanted to build something which can bring back the old memories from my favorite places. I had recently got my hands on an e-paper display and such displays mimic the appearance of ink on a good old paper. Perfect! I made a photo frame using a PCB showing my favorite places on a map. Touching any one of the location pads displays an image from that place on the e-paper display.
